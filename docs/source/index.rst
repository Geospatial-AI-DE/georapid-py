Geospatial Knowledge for Geospatial Intelligence
================================================
Query broadcasted news worldwide and visualize them using spatial aggregations.

This modern Python module represents an idiomatic client accessing the `Geospatial Knowledge APIs <https://geospatial-ai.de/?rara_portfolio_categories=api-services>`__ being hosted on `Rapid API Hub <https://rapidapi.com/hub>`__.

Geospatial Knowledge refers to semantic information about specific locations on the Earth's surface. 
It includes location-enabled things - not strings - like physical features of the landscape, the location of cities or in general human activities, and their spatial distribution. 
Various sources like satellite imagery, location-enabled datasets, and most important any location-enabled information in the context of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) are used to create Geospatial Knowledge. 
By analyzing location-enabled things an analyst is empowered to gain insights into various aspects of human activities.
